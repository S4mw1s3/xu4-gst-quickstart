In the test both 1080p and 720p versions are used.

test1-*: *offline encode and decode test*
Just make sure we can decode and encode a movie in good enough time
1080p is too slow
720p finishes decode and encode in 36 minutes.

test3*: *client tests*
Test3 shows the multicasting of the original streams.
This is necessary to decide if your *client* is able to play it at all.
1080p is unplayable in low end pc's
720p is ok on low end pc's

Test4*:
Use videotestsrc as a source... arg1 is pattern...
0 is the default
18 is a bouncing ball...
1 is snow which probably brakes everything.
videotestsrc is very heavy...
This *will* break your encoder...

Test5:
real working uvc webcam streaming.

Test6:
Really not working uvc webcam and audio streaming. It stalls.

Test7:
screencast of desktop.


If you want to see the data flows, do this:
export GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=$PWD/tmp/
mkdir tmp
before starting an example...
gstreamer will create dot compatible files for each state transition.
After installing graphviz, you can dot -Tsvg <file> > graph.svg
and view the svg with your browser
